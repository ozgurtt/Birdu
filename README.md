#Fishu

I am working on a fish-eats-fish game to acclimate myself to the phaser ecosystem. Basic instructions on what I've done as are follows:


```
#first, install phaser game generator for easy, consistent phaser setup ::: #https://github.com/codevinsky/generator-phaser-official
#install npm, then yo (you can figure this out yourself)
sudo npm install -g yo generator-phaser-official % npm installs the tool

npm install -g grunt-cli #install grunt (task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects)

yo phaser-official #current version is 2.4.6 at time of writing
grunt #will auto-compile JS file as you modify code, and will save production output to /dist directory
```
